    <Paragraph>
      Making a prediction means buying tokens for the outcome that you believe will occur at a price point/probability
      that you consider as reasonable and that will result in a maximum payout once the market is resolved.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      When clicking on a prediction market from the Dashboard or Market Overview, you’ll be navigated to the market’s
      detail page. It includes a description of the prediction market and presents the probabilities of the different
      outcome options (for categorical events) or the currently estimated price (for scalar events).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      You’ll find more detailed information about the market such as token type, fee percentage, total funding, current
      trading volume, or creator of the market in the sidebar.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>You are able to participate in the market from the Market Details Page.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Here, you can buy or sell tokens, navigate to My Tokens, providing you with an overview of your current token
      holdings, or you can view your transactions in the My Trades tab .
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Depending on whether you’re predicting a categorical event or a scalar event, you’ll be able to trade outcome or
      short/long tokens (see <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/getting-to-the-core-4db11a31c35f">this blog</a> post for a
      detailed explanation on trading in prediction markets on categorical and scalar events).

      <br />
      Selling outcome tokens you hold in a market means exiting your position in that market in return for OLY. You
      would sell outcome tokens either because you changed your mind about the winning outcome, or because you think
      exiting the market at the current price point will lead to the highest payout for you. That is, you believe the
      probability of an outcome will not increase any further.
