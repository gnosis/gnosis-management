      To participate in our two-week tournament, verify your identity by signing up via the uPort app on Android or iOS.{' '}

      uPort is a secure, easy-to-use system for self-sovereign identity, built on Ethereum. uPort identities are fully
      owned and controlled by the creator, and don&apos;t rely on centralized third-parties for creation or validation.
      Via uPort, you can own and control your personal identity; securely and selectively disclose your data to
      counterparties, and interact with decentralized applications and smart contracts such as Gnosis.
