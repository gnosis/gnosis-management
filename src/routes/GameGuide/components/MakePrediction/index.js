      When clicking on a prediction market from the Dashboard or Market Overview, you’ll be navigated to the market’s
      detail page. It includes a description of the prediction market and presents the probabilities of the different
      outcome options (for categorical events) or the currently estimated price (for scalar events).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      You’ll find more detailed information about the market such as token type, fee percentage, total funding, current
      trading volume, or creator of the market in the sidebar.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      From within this detail page, you&apos;ll be able to participate in the prediction market.<br />
      You can buy tokens in the market, navigate to your current token holdings at My Tokens, as well as display your
      transactions in this market at My Trades.

      detailed explanation on trading in prediction markets on categorical and scalar events).
