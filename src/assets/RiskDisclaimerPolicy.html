The following document aims to be comprehensive but cannot be complete.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Trading on prediction markets carry a high degree of risk, and you should not trade in such markets unless you understand their nature, and your own exposure to risk, subject to your circumstances and financial situation. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial deposit and therefore you should not place funds that you cannot afford to lose; that is, trade with amounts that, if lost, will not adversely impact your lifestyle and your ability to meet your financial obligations. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If you do not fully understand the risks associated with trading, you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. All trading strategies are used at your own risk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Although prediction markets can be used for risk management, they are not necessarily suitable for all tradings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Past performance is no guarantee of future performance, since future performance of underlying assets is unpredictable, and many external factors might influence the probabilities of the outcomes at any time. We recommend that you keep close tabs on your trades and their status, and monitor the fluctuation in prices, and any world events that might influence your trades prices. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Before trading, examine the market&rsquo;s volume of trade, all positions, their marginal prices/probabilities, and all fees related to the market, and establish the risks and opportunity, and the charges that might incur. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Profits or losses from transactions denominated in a currency may be subject to fluctuations in exchanges. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The information contained in this web page does not constitute financial advice or a solicitation to buy or sell shares of any type. Therefore, only make trades in market topics in which you have profound knowledge. We will not accept liability for any loss or damage, including without limitation any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from use of or reliance on such information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c8">Markets of High Volatility</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c9">Prediction markets</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;require trading against marginal prices of outcome tokens. Please note that the marginal prices of outcome tokens might be subject to slippage that may occur when underlying markets are volatile and marginal prices move rapidly, which might impact your position and the cost of your trade. Please note that we limit this slippage to a maximum of 5% beyond which the transaction gets rejected, in order to prevent higher volumes of loss. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c8">Technology Related Risks</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All funds during market trading are held in event contracts. Although event contracts are considered reliable and secure, no such system is guaranteed to be totally reliable at all times, as vulnerabilities might be discovered in the smart contracts, which might result in loss of funds, although this is unlikely. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connection. Since Gnosis does not control signal power, its reception or routing via Internet, configuration of your equipment or reliability of its connection, we cannot be responsible for communication failures, distortions or delays when trading via the Internet.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Risks associated with </span><span class="c5">Oracles</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In case of a market becoming invalid, as in if no oracle were able to resolve the market, user funds will be refunded, but fees are non-refundable. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We are the only oracle for the Gnosis Ops markets. If we decided for the wrong outcome, we will also refund customers out of our own funds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c8">Taxation</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Profits and losses resulting from trading are legally enforceable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Taxation on profits made from trading on prediction markets are subject to local laws, rules and regulations. The trader is responsible for any stamp duty or taxes due in respect of profits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Traders who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their own independent tax advisers. In addition, traders should be aware that tax regulations and their application by the relevant taxation authorities change from time to time. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the precise tax treatment which will apply at any given time.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c8">Availability</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This website is not intended for use by any person in any country where such services or use would be contrary to local law or regulation.
