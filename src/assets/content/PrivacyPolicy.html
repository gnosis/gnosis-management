Your information and the Blockchain</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (or simply &lsquo;DLT&rsquo;), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called &lsquo;blocks&rsquo;. The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Accordingly, by design, a blockchain&rsquo;s records cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be &lsquo;immutable&rsquo;.
